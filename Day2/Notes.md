# Day 2 â€“ Brute Force Attack Detection (RDP)

## ðŸ”¹ Offensive Simulation (Hydra)
- Ran Hydra against the Azure VM RDP service (`98.70.40.100`) using a custom wordlist:
  ```bash
  hydra -l labuser -P pass.txt -t 1 -W 3 rdp://98.70.40.100
Hydra generated multiple failed logon attempts and eventually succeeded with the correct password.

Outcome:

Event ID 4625 (failed logons) created in Windows Security logs.

Event ID 4624 (successful logon) created when the correct password was found.

ðŸ”¹ Remediation
The account labuser was compromised.

Performed password reset on the VM to block attacker persistence.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome
Successfully simulated and detected an RDP brute-force attack.

Verified in Sentinel logs using KQL queries.

Applied remediation by resetting the compromised account password.
