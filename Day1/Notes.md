# Day 1 â€“ Azure Setup & First Attack

## ðŸ”¹ VM Setup
- Created Azure Free Account.
- Created Resource Group: **SC200-Lab-RG**.
- Deployed Windows 10 Pro VM (**WinVM01**, size B2s).
- Configured Networking: Allowed RDP (3389).

## ðŸ”¹ Offensive Activity
- From Kali: ran Nmap scans on VM Public IP.
  ```bash
  nmap -A -Pn <VM_Public_IP>
Observed open ports (RDP, later HTTP/other services as enabled).

## ðŸ”¹ Defensive Setup
Created Log Analytics Workspace: SC200-WS.

Enabled Microsoft Sentinel on workspace.

Connected VM â†’ Logs flowing into workspace.

Configured Data Collection Rule (SC200-DCR) to collect Windows Security Events.

Verified logs with query:

Event
| where EventLog == "Security"
| take 10
ðŸ”¹ Observations
Successfully saw Security events in the Event table.

Failed logons (Event ID 4625) confirmed when testing wrong RDP logins.<img width="1917" height="919" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 191212" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92adeeaf-2115-4541-a4ca-8a30c33f7d60" />

ðŸ”¹ Next Steps (Day 2)

Simulate brute-force attack using Hydra.

Detect failed logins (Event ID 4625 flood).

Create Sentinel Analytic Rule for brute-force detection.

Document results as Incident Report #1.
